#  Smart Inventory & Order Management System

An enterprise-grade microservices-based platform to manage inventory, process customer orders, auto-replenish stock, and send real-time notifications. This system demonstrates key principles of modern backend architecture including domain-driven design, event-driven communication, containerized deployment, and secure API access.

## Features

-  Role-Based Access Control via Keycloak (Admin, Customer, Warehouse Manager)
-  Inventory Management with auto-replenishment logic
-  Order Processing using event-driven Kafka architecture
-  Asynchronous Notifications (Email/SMS) via Kafka
-  Real-Time Reporting & Monitoring via Prometheus & Grafana
-  OAuth2 and JWT-secured APIs with API Gateway
-  Resilient service-to-service communication with Resilience4j circuit breakers
